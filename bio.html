		Biography
		<br/>
		I was born in Urbana, IL on June 2nd, 1994 in Carle Hospital. To greet me into the world were my two parents, Jim and Laurie, and my two sisters, Sam and Sarah. While Sarah had been around for a while, having 3 good years with our parents to herself, Sam only predated me by 90 minutes. An hour and a half is long for twins but pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of things meaning Sam would be my constant companion for the first 18 years of my life.
		<br/>
		Life in Urbana was relatively normal and quiet, as it was a small university town located within the rural midwest. I attended pre-k at Creative Discovery School before making the big switch, or at least it seemed big at the time, to Leal Elementary School for grades 1-5. Another school switch to Urbana Middle School for what I thought would be my entire middle school career but a job oppurtunity for my dad at Northwestern and my maternal grandparents' residence in Chicago led to a move north to Evanston, IL.

		One year of middle school left, I went to eigth grade at Nichols Middle School. It was one of three public middle schools within Evanston, there were also a couple private ones, and all of them filtered into Evanston Township High School. Despite talks of my parents to switch me to a smaller high school after freshman year because of concerns with my falling grades, I would attend ETHS all four years. Somewhere along the way in high school, and probably because of a crush on my camp counselor, I would set my heart on Tufts University. 
		<br/>
		Tufts was a reach for me yet I somehow got in and I have been beyond happy to call it my home for the past three and a half years. A brief detour in my stay here was a semester in Ireland in the fall of 2014, a fun interlude in which I was reunited (location-wise, obviously we saw each other consistently after high school) with my twin sister. And now, here I am, 100 days from graduating and no idea of my direction in life writing an overly poetic and incredibly unprofessional biography for a comp sci class. Life is weird.
